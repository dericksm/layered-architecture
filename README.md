# layered-architecture-example
This project is not a example of Clean Architecture, or Hexagonal Architecture, or Ports and Adapters, it's my own view of a "layered architecture" inspired by all these ideas behind these architectures

This is a simple "library" application where you can create and search books which was separated by different layers and abstractions, and highly inspired over the Clean Architecture

# Are there enough layers?
My own answer is probably that not, but we can take how many indirections as we need and it might never feel enough.
