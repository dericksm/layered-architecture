# layered-architecture-example
This project is not an example of Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, or Ports and Adapters, it's my own view of a "layered architecture" inspired by all the ideas behind these architectures

This is a simple "library" application where you can create and search books which were separated by different layers and abstractions, and highly inspired by the Clean Architecture

# Are there enough layers?
My own answer is probably that not, but we can take how many indirections as we need and it might never feel enough.
